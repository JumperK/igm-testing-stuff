# What is this?
Hello, this is an experimental project that I have created to "test the water" in Orteil's [Idle Game Maker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/), with various different tests being performed.

## What's currently included?
At the moment, there are several that are being tested, which includes:

- Includes -- A complicated feature that helps cut down *drastically* on written code
- Formatting & Customized Stylesheet -- Making it *more* presentable than the Default Stylesheet
- Rebirths -- Can't have an Idle Incremental without *some* way to rebirth

## Where Can I Play This?
You can [Play It Here](https://orteil.dashnet.org/igm/?g=)!

## Closing Words
I hope that this works, as I have been struggling to make some of these work.
